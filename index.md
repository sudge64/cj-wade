## About {#about .about}

I'm a Computer Science graduate with a concentration in software
engineering.

I like to work in low-level environments, microcontrollers for instance.
The RP2040 being a favorite of mine.

I'm always ready to work on new and exciting technologies! My tools help
people to rid themselves of trivial, repeatable tasks. Sometimes, I work
on some fun projects such as PCB design.
