<p>Hello! My name is Christian J. Wade, but please, call me C.J.</p>
<p>I’m a Computer Science graduate with a concentration in software engineering.</p>
<p>I like to work in low-level environments, microcontrollers for instance. The RP2040 being a favorite of mine.</p>
<p>I’m always ready to work on new and exciting technologies! My tools help people to rid themselves of trivial, repeatable tasks. Sometimes, I work on some fun projects such as PCB design.</p>
