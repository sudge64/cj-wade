<h1>Intro</h1>
<p>In today’s world, we interact with computers and techonology every
day. We place a large amount of trust in our computers and the operating
systems that run on them.</p>
<p>But, we rarely stop and ask ourselves if the operating systems that
we use are worthy of that trust. All your data is being harvested, not
just online but through your company owned operating systems as
well.</p>
<p>Thankfully, there are alternative operating systems that offer more
than the standard that we are used to. Enter Linux.</p>
<p>A little about me, I am a Computer Science major who has personally
used <code>Linux</code> fulltime starting from 2019. I also have used
<code>Windows</code> from when I started using computers, with
<code>macOS</code> not long after.</p>

that is not constrained by the bottom line of a business, or by
sacrificing the privacy of its users, or even by obscuring hidden
functions in code that is not viewable by the end user.</li>
<li>You might think that credit should be given to both projects when
refering to them in their fused state, if so, you might get along well
with Stallman who champions <code>GNU/Linux</code> as the proper name.

<h1>Conclusion</h1>
<p>All in all, <code>Linux</code> has a much greater emphasis on
privacy. This emphasis comes from multiple sources, both the philosophy
of Stallman when initiating the GNU Project, and from the people who
work on it today. They have no need to harvest data from their own
users, they just want to make something that they would enjoy using
themselves.</p>
<p><code>Linux</code> may not be for everyone, in fact, I will tell you
that it’s not. However, it might be for you. Will you ever know if you
don’t try?</p>
