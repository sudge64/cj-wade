Built with pure `markdown` and `css`. Rendered to `html` via [pandoc](https://pandoc.org/).

Inspired by [Tavis Ormandy](https://github.com/taviso)'s [website](https://cmpxchg8b.com/index.html) and [z8](https://github.com/0x666690)'s [website](https://z8.re/).

[Will Styler](https://wstyler.ucsd.edu/index.html)'s [page over the topic](https://wstyler.ucsd.edu/posts/pandoc_website.html) was a great help.

For `GitHub Pages`, deployment occurs from `docs`.
