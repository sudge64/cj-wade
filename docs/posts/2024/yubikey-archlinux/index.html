    <main><h1>How to Get a Yubikey working on Arch Linux</h1>
<p>In recent months, I've been becoming more and more security conscious. To that end, I've invested in hardware security keys, but have had a bear of a time getting them to work on Arch Linux (my operating system of choice, by the way).</p>
<p>This morning I've finally had a break through and thought I'd share my findings.</p>
<h2>Problem</h2>
<p>I'm using the offical <a href="https://www.yubico.com/products/yubico-authenticator/#h-download-yubico-authenticator">Yubico Authenticator</a> app and no accounts, passkeys, certificates, or slots would show up in their tabs. Thankfully, the key itself did show up.</p>
<p><img src="/img/yubi_failure.png" alt="An incredibily helpful error message."></p>
<p>Launching the app from the terminal showed that there was an infinite loop of the authenticator failing to find whatever it was looking for.</p>
<p>Okay, so the app can't talk to something on the back end, my first thought being a system service of some sort.</p>
<h2>A Partial Solution</h2>
<p>A quick search found <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/yubikey/comments/stnuua/how_do_i_get_yubico_authenticator_to_work_on/">this Reddit thread</a>, where the top comment confirmed my theory. You need to enable the <code>pcscd</code> service. Now, this service is for interfacing with smart cards (more reading <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Smartcards">here</a>), and smart cards are not as profilic today as they once were, so you will need to install the <code>pcsclite</code> package.</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">sudo pacman -S pcsclite
</code></pre>
<p>The Arch Wiki page linked above also recommends installing the <code>ccid</code> package, <em>which provides a generic USB interface for smart cards.</em> <a href="#1">1</a></p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">sudo pacman -S ccid
</code></pre>
<p>Now we can enable the service.</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">sudo systemctl enable pcscd.service
sudo systemctl start pcscd.service
</code></pre>
<p>In my experience, this alone does not fix the issue and I still receive the above error message.</p>
<h2>The Final Piece of the Puzzle</h2>
<p>All that build-up brings us to today. I was playing around with enabling and disabling the serivce, and on a whim, I decided to check the status of the service. This output immediately caught my eye:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">pcscd.service: Referenced but unset environment variable evaluates to an empty string: PCSCD_ARGS
</code></pre>
<p>Plugging that into your search engine of choice should lead you to this <a href="https://ludovicrousseau.blogspot.com/2021/08/pcsc-lite-configuration-using.html">blog post by Ludovic Rousseau</a>. At the end of the article, is this snippet:</p>
<p><em>### pcscd arguments</em></p>
<p><em>pcscd is started with the extra parameter $PCSCD_ARGS. By default this variable is empty. But you can define PCSCD_ARGS in /etc/default/pcscd to add more arguments to pcscd.</em></p>
<p><em>For example you can use:</em></p>
<p><em><code>PCSCD_ARGS=--debug</code></em></p>
<p><em>to get debug messages in the systemd journal.</em> <a href="#2">2</a></p>
<p>Additionally, Rousseau mentions that the default configuration file for <code>pcscd.serivce</code> is located at <code>/etc/default/pcscd</code>. I created the file as the super user, added the single line <code>PCSCD_ARGS=--debug</code>, and restarted the service.</p>
<p>Voila! The authenticator was now working perfectly!</p>
<p><img src="/img/yubi_success.png" alt="The Authenticator working as expected."></p>
<p>It is my hope that having this information in one spot can help someone down the road.</p>
<h2>A Bashful Realization</h2>
<p>So, while writing this post, I checked the man page for <code>pcscd</code> and noticed this section:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">CONFIGURATION FILE
       It is possible to set arguments that will be used by pcscd with the configuration
        file /etc/default/pcscd For example you can increase the debug level using:
              PCSCD_ARGS=--debug

       Or set environment variables like:
              PCSCLITE_FILTER_IGNORE_READER_NAMES=&quot;Twin&quot;
              PCSCLITE_FILTER_EXTEND_READER_NAMES=&quot; $HOSTNAME&quot;

       See https://blog.apdu.fr/posts/2021/08/pcsc-lite-configuration-using/ ⟨⟩ for more details.
